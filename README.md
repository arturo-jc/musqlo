## About

MUSQLO is a Flask application designed to create workout programs based on linear progression&mdash;that is, programs where the weight of the lifts increases by a set amount every session.

To create a program, start by creating a weekly schedule. What exercises are you supposed to perform each day of the week? Once you've created a schedule, enter the following:

* Starting date
* Pogram duration
* Starting weight for each exercise
* Increment per session

Once you've entered all this, the app will generate the desired program.
